# **SymNMF Clustering Algorithm Software Project**

An efficient implementation of the **Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF)** algorithm, designed for clustering data represented by symmetric, non-negative matrices. SymNMF is particularly valuable in applications like text mining, image processing, and community detection in networks, where non-negative and symmetric data structures are commonly used.

## **Features**

- Implements Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF) for clustering.
- Scalable to large datasets with optimized performance.
- Includes example datasets and visualization tools for easy interpretation of clustering results.

## **Installation**

To get started, clone this repository and install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AvivYehuda1/SymNMF-clustering-algorithm-Software-Project.git
cd SymNMF-clustering-algorithm-Software-Project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**

Here’s a quick start guide to using the SymNMF implementation:

```python
from symnmf_module import SymNMF  # Replace with your actual module name

# Load or create a sample symmetric non-negative dataset
data = load_sample_data()  # Replace with your actual data loading function

# Initialize and fit the model
model = SymNMF(data)
clusters = model.fit_predict()

# Display clustering results
print(clusters)
```

## **Project Structure**

- `symnmf.py`: Contains the main implementation of the SymNMF algorithm.
- `data_loader.py`: Scripts to load and preprocess sample datasets.
- `evaluate.py`: Code for evaluating clustering results, including common metrics.
- `visualize.py`: Visualization tools to help interpret clustering results.

## **Examples**

To visualize the clustering results, you can use the `visualize.py` module:

```python
from visualize import plot_clusters

plot_clusters(data, clusters)  # This will create a scatter plot of the clusters
```

The visualization will display each cluster in a different color, helping you understand the grouping created by the SymNMF algorithm.
